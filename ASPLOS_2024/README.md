## Abstract
In the next few years, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are expected to become pivotal in quantum computing applications. Recent studies highlight the importance of Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) in overcoming the data input and output (I/O) challenges inherent in quantum-classical data processing. This tutorial will provide an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computation, the comprehensive architecture of QRAM, and the essentials of hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms. A special focus will be on a C++ quantum SDK, developed by Intel for the effective execution of these algorithms. Attendees will be guided through the steps of developing, compiling, and executing hybrid quantum-classical programs. With a strong emphasis on practical experience, the session will involve participants in actively writing and applying C++ code to address problems.
